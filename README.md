## Data Cleaning and Processing

### Cleaning Data in Excel
- Removed index for clarity.
- Processed salary estimates to standardize and make them more meaningful.
- Converted "company founded" to "company age" for a more relevant metric.
- Removed competitors' rows with insufficient data.

### Creating Tables and Metrics
- Developed tables of skills to identify demand in different areas.
- Determined job positions and seniority levels based on job titles.
- Implemented date-related metrics to analyze trends over time.

## Excel Formulas and Techniques Used

```excel
=SUBSTITUTE(C2, "$", "")  // Removing dollar signs from salary estimates
=VALUE(LEFT(C2, FIND("-", C2) - 1))  // Extracting minimum salary
=IF(ISNUMBER(SEARCH("Python", D2)), 1, 0)  // Creating a table of Python skills
=IF(ISNUMBER(SEARCH("data scientist", B2)), "data scientist", ...)  // Identifying job positions
=RANDBETWEEN(DATE(2021,1,1),DATE(2021,12,31))  // Generating random dates for analysis
