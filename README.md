- Determined job positions and seniority levels based on job titles.
- Implemented date-related metrics to analyze trends over time.


## Excel Formulas and Techniques Used

```excel
=SUBSTITUTE(C2, "$", "")  // Removing dollar signs from salary estimates
=VALUE(LEFT(C2, FIND("-", C2) - 1))  // Extracting minimum salary
=IF(ISNUMBER(SEARCH("Python", D2)), 1, 0)  // Creating a table of Python skills
=IF(ISNUMBER(SEARCH("data scientist", B2)), "data scientist", ...)  // Identifying job positions
=RANDBETWEEN(DATE(2021,1,1),DATE(2021,12,31))  // Generating random dates for analysis
